# My Shopify Store
If I was to open a  Shopify Store, then I would sell desserts as I enjoy baking and they are also my favourite type of food to eat.

The shop would contain a wide variety of desserts ranging from cute little cupcakes to creamy ice creams. Sweet treats are a great hit with people as everyone seems to have a sweet tooth. The desserts would also be diabetic friendly.

Apart from this, many special occasions revolve around these delicacies and would be bought a lot and this would prove to be profitable in the long run as well.
I even used the business name generator, logo maker and slogan generator on Shopify and came up with the following:
- Name - `Treats Den`
- Slogan - `Treats of a New Generation`
- Logo
